Image Processing
================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

The vision algorithms in the :doc:`../api-reference/image` module come from OpenMV's ``imlib`` library, maintained in this repository as the ``components/imlib`` IDF component. They fall into a few families: point and geometric transforms, neighborhood filters, statistical analysis, and feature detection. This page explains what each family does and when to reach for it.

A typical processing pipeline
-----------------------------

Most color-tracking or inspection scripts follow this processing flow:

.. blockdiag::

   blockdiag {
     orientation = portrait;

     capture    [label = "Capture\nsensor.snapshot()"];
     preprocess [label = "Pre-process\nconvert / denoise / normalize"];
     segment    [label = "Segment\nbinary thresholds"];
     analyze    [label = "Analyze\nblobs / statistics / features"];
     output     [label = "Annotate or act"];

     capture -> preprocess -> segment -> analyze -> output;
   }

Pre-processing can combine :py:meth:`image.Image.to_grayscale`, :py:meth:`image.Image.gaussian`, and :py:meth:`image.Image.histeq`; segmentation commonly uses :py:meth:`image.Image.binary`; analysis then uses :py:meth:`image.Image.find_blobs`, :py:meth:`image.Image.get_statistics`, or a feature detector before the application draws results or takes an action.

Thresholding and segmentation
-----------------------------

:py:meth:`image.Image.binary` converts the image into a mask by testing each pixel against a list of color thresholds (see :doc:`image-model` for why thresholds are expressed in LAB). A pixel is "on" if it falls inside *any* of the supplied thresholds, which lets you track several colors at once. The companion :py:meth:`image.Image.find_blobs` runs an 8-connected component labeling pass over the same thresholds and returns one :py:class:`image.blob` per connected region, with centroid, bounding box, pixel count, orientation, and shape descriptors such as roundness and solidity.

Neighborhood (convolution) filters
-----------------------------------

These replace each pixel with a function of its ``(2*ksize+1)`` square neighborhood:

- :py:meth:`image.Image.mean` -- box average; fast blur.
- :py:meth:`image.Image.gaussian` -- weighted average using a Pascal-triangle (binomial) approximation of a Gaussian; the standard noise-reduction blur. Set ``unsharp=True`` to sharpen instead.
- :py:meth:`image.Image.laplacian` -- second-derivative edge response; set ``sharpen=True`` to add it back to the original for edge enhancement.
- :py:meth:`image.Image.morph` -- apply an arbitrary integer kernel. ``mul`` and ``add`` scale and bias the result; the default ``mul`` is ``1/sum(kernel)`` so the image brightness is preserved.

All of these share ``threshold``/``offset``/``invert`` keywords that turn the filter into an adaptive thresholding operation in a single pass.

Rank and edge-preserving filters
---------------------------------

Rank filters sort the neighborhood instead of averaging it, which removes noise without blurring edges as much:

- :py:meth:`image.Image.median` -- the percentile (default 0.5) value; excellent against salt-and-pepper noise.
- :py:meth:`image.Image.mode` -- the most common value.
- :py:meth:`image.Image.midpoint` -- a ``bias`` blend between the min and max.
- :py:meth:`image.Image.bilateral` -- a Gaussian blur weighted by both spatial distance (``space_sigma``) and color similarity (``color_sigma``), so it smooths flat regions while keeping edges crisp.

Morphology
----------

:py:meth:`image.Image.erode` and :py:meth:`image.Image.dilate` grow or shrink the set pixels of a (usually binary) image using a square structuring element; :py:meth:`image.Image.open` and :py:meth:`image.Image.close` combine them to remove specks or fill small holes. The ``threshold`` argument controls how many neighbors must be set, generalizing the classic binary operators.

Histograms and statistics
-------------------------

:py:meth:`image.Image.get_histogram` bins pixel values per channel; the returned :py:class:`image.histogram` can compute Otsu thresholds (:py:meth:`image.histogram.get_threshold`), percentiles, and full statistics. :py:meth:`image.Image.get_statistics` returns mean, median, mode, standard deviation, quartiles, and min/max in one call, which is useful for auto-tuning thresholds at runtime.

Feature detection
-----------------

Higher-level detectors find geometric structure:

- :py:meth:`image.Image.find_lines` and :py:meth:`image.Image.find_circles` use the Hough transform; their ``threshold`` is the minimum accumulator score and the ``*_margin`` keywords merge near-duplicate results.
- :py:meth:`image.Image.find_rects` locates quadrilaterals (useful for fiducials and screens).
- :py:meth:`image.Image.find_qrcodes` and :py:meth:`image.Image.find_apriltags` detect and decode the corresponding marker types; AprilTags can additionally return 6-DoF pose when camera intrinsics are supplied.

.. only:: esp32p4

   The current ESP32-P4 board profiles additionally provide :py:meth:`image.Image.find_barcodes` through the ZXing-C++ backend.

.. note::

   GPL-licensed OpenMV code paths are disabled in this build (``OMV_NO_GPL=1``), so a small number of upstream algorithms are intentionally unavailable. The per-board ``imlib_config.h`` selects which optional algorithms are compiled in; a method that is not enabled raises an exception at call time.
