Codecs and Streaming
====================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

Once you have a frame you often want to *get it off the board*: preview it on a host, record it, or stream it live. ESP-VISION offers several codecs and transports, each suited to a different use case.

Still-image codecs: JPEG and PNG
--------------------------------

:py:meth:`image.Image.to_jpeg` (and its alias :py:meth:`image.Image.compress`) encodes a frame to JPEG. JPEG is lossy: the ``quality`` keyword (1-100) trades size for fidelity, and ``subsampling`` controls how aggressively chroma is reduced (``JPEG_SUBSAMPLING_420`` is smallest, ``444`` is best quality). On boards with a hardware JPEG encoder this is offloaded; otherwise a software encoder (``esp_new_jpeg``) is used. :py:meth:`image.Image.to_png` produces lossless PNG, which is larger but exact -- useful for saving reference frames.

Recording sequences: ImageIO
----------------------------

:py:class:`imageio.ImageIO` records a *sequence* of frames with their inter-frame timing preserved, so playback runs at the original speed. A **file stream** writes a container on storage; a **memory stream** keeps frames in a pre-allocated PSRAM buffer for fast capture and replay. See :doc:`../api-reference/imageio`.

   Video codec: H.264
   ------------------

   For continuous video, per-frame JPEG is wasteful because it cannot exploit the similarity between consecutive frames. :py:class:`h264.H264Encoder` produces an H.264 stream where occasional **keyframes** (IDR/I) are self-contained and the frames between them only encode what changed. The encoder's parameters tune this trade-off:

   - ``gop`` -- keyframe interval. Shorter means faster recovery and easier seeking but larger output; ``0`` selects one keyframe per second.
   - ``bitrate`` -- target bits per second; the dominant size/quality control.
   - ``qp_min`` / ``qp_max`` -- bound the per-frame quantizer.

   A lost P-frame corrupts the picture until the next keyframe, which matters for the streaming transport below.

   Network streaming: RTSP
   -----------------------

   :py:class:`rtsp.RTSPServer` serves encoded H.264 frames over RTSP so a client such as VLC or ffplay can view the camera at ``rtsp://<board-ip>:8554/``. Feed each :py:meth:`h264.H264Encoder.encode` result to :py:meth:`rtsp.RTSPServer.send`.

   .. blockdiag::

      blockdiag {
        orientation = portrait;

        capture [label = "Capture\nsensor.snapshot()"];
        encode  [label = "Encode\nH264Encoder.encode()"];
        queue   [label = "Queue complete frames\nRTSPServer.send()"];
        client  [label = "Stream to\nRTSP client"];

        capture -> encode -> queue -> client;
        client -> capture [label = "next frame"];
      }

   The server keeps a short, in-order frame queue; if a client is slow or absent it drops whole frames rather than blocking the capture loop or sending a partial frame that would corrupt the stream.

Host preview: USB CDC
---------------------

During development the quickest way to *see* what the camera sees is :py:meth:`image.Image.flush`, which pushes the current frame to the host as an EVFRAME JPEG preview over USB CDC. The companion host tool decodes and displays it. This path needs no Wi-Fi and no SD card, making it the default feedback loop while iterating on a script.
