Target and Board Support
========================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

ESP-VISION documentation is built separately for each IDF target. Select the same target as the board firmware so module and API availability match the default build.

Supported Development Boards
----------------------------

.. include:: _generated/boards.rst

Target Versus Board Capabilities
--------------------------------

The target controls chip-level source selection. For example, ``h264`` and ``rtsp`` are added by ``micropython.cmake`` only when ``IDF_TARGET`` is ``esp32p4``. A board profile can further enable or disable features such as the ZXing-C++ barcode backend through ``boards/<BOARD>/board.cmake``.

The API navigation and target-specific symbol conditions are generated from these build files. This makes ``micropython.cmake``, ``overlay/micropython/ports/esp32/boards/*/mpconfigboard.cmake``, and board ``board.cmake`` files authoritative for ESP-VISION API availability.

Standard MicroPython Features
-----------------------------

Standard MicroPython features use a separate configuration path: ``overlay/micropython/ports/esp32/mpconfigport.h`` plus each board's ``mpconfigboard.h``. The table above indexes the explicitly enabled baseline features from those files. Some conditions also depend on the ESP-IDF version or SoC capability macros.

ESP-IDF 5.5 provides the more complete standard MicroPython feature set. In addition to the ``network`` module, WLAN, and sockets, it enables SSL/TLS, ``cryptolib``, WebSocket, WebREPL, and socket events. ``machine.I2S`` and ESP32 PCNT are also enabled when supported by the selected SoC. Supported chips can use the I2C target mode introduced for ESP-IDF 5.4 and newer.

With the ESP-VISION overlay, ESP-IDF 6.0 or newer continues to support the standard ``network`` module, WLAN, and sockets. SSL/TLS, ``cryptolib``, WebSocket, WebREPL, socket events, ``machine.I2S``, and ESP32 PCNT remain disabled on that IDF line. The S31 port also provides the default hostname ``mpy-esp32s31``.

The current board headers disable Bluetooth and ESP-NOW; the S31 board additionally disables ``machine.ADC`` and ``machine.ADCBlock``. A board must still provide suitable networking hardware and firmware configuration before ``network.WLAN`` can connect.

Because these conditions are not target-only, the target selector filters the ESP-VISION API reference but does not claim to be a complete standard MicroPython module manifest.

The target documentation describes the defaults shared by the current board profiles. A custom board or modified build option can therefore differ from the published target page. When that happens, the firmware configuration is authoritative.

Building a Target
-----------------

.. code-block:: bash

   build-docs -l en -t esp32p4
   build-docs -l en -t esp32s3
   build-docs -l en -t esp32s31

The output is written to ``docs/_build/<language>/<target>/html/``.
