API Reference
=============

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

ESP-VISION exposes its functionality through C-implemented MicroPython modules. The public module names stay OpenMV-compatible: the camera module is ``sensor``, with ``image``, ``display``, and ``espdl`` alongside it. The codec stream type is exposed as ``image.ImageIO``. This page only lists modules compiled for the selected target.

The pages below are the reference for each module. They are kept in sync with the type stubs under ``stubs/``, which are also usable for IDE completion. Module availability is derived from ``micropython.cmake`` during the documentation build.

This guide covers ESP-VISION modules. Standard MicroPython modules are selected by ``overlay/micropython/ports/esp32/mpconfigport.h``, board-level ``mpconfigboard.h`` overrides, ESP-IDF version checks, and SoC capability macros. Their availability therefore cannot always be determined from target alone.
