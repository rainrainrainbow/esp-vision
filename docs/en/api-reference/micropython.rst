MicroPython APIs
================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

ESP-VISION is built on the MicroPython ESP32 port and directly retains its language, standard-library, hardware-control, networking, filesystem, and runtime APIs. These APIs can be used together with ``sensor``, ``image``, ``display``, ``espdl``, and the other ESP-VISION modules in the same script; ESP-VISION does not wrap or rename them.

Documentation Baseline
----------------------

ESP-VISION pins MicroPython v1.28.0. Use the `MicroPython v1.28.0 documentation <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/>`_ as the authoritative API reference, especially the `MicroPython libraries <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/library/index.html>`_ and `ESP32 quick reference <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/esp32/quickref.html>`_. MicroPython implements a resource-oriented subset of CPython, so CPython documentation must not be treated as an exact description of module contents or behavior.

Language and Built-in APIs
--------------------------

ESP-VISION retains the MicroPython language and built-in types, functions, exceptions, iteration protocol, context managers, classes, and asynchronous syntax. See `MicroPython language and implementation <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/reference/index.html>`_ and `builtins <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/library/builtins.html>`_ for details.

Use exceptions and context managers to keep long-running vision applications recoverable and to close files deterministically:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       with open("/sdcard/result.txt", "w") as output:
           output.write("capture complete\n")
   except OSError as error:
       print("storage error:", error)

Standard and Micro Libraries
----------------------------

Common inherited modules include ``array``, ``asyncio``, ``binascii``, ``cmath``, ``collections``, ``errno``, ``gc``, ``gzip``, ``hashlib``, ``heapq``, ``io``, ``json``, ``marshal``, ``math``, ``os``, ``platform``, ``random``, ``re``, ``select``, ``socket``, ``struct``, ``sys``, ``time``, ``weakref``, ``zlib``, and ``_thread``. ESP-VISION board manifests also freeze MicroPython's ``asyncio`` package into the firmware.

Refer to the `MicroPython library index <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/library/index.html>`_ for each module's classes and functions. A documented upstream module may still be omitted or reduced by the selected firmware configuration.

JSON and Time Example
---------------------

.. code-block:: python

   import json, time

   result = {
       "timestamp_ms": time.ticks_ms(),
       "objects": 3,
       "confidence": 0.91,
   }
   payload = json.dumps(result)
   print(payload)

``time.ticks_ms()`` is suitable for measuring intervals and generating local runtime timestamps; use ``time.ticks_diff()`` when subtracting tick values so wraparound is handled correctly. ``json`` is useful for serializing inference results before storage or network transmission.

Hardware and ESP32 APIs
-----------------------

The inherited `machine <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/library/machine.html>`_ module provides MCU control and peripheral classes including ``Pin``, ``Signal``, ``ADC``, ``ADCBlock``, ``PWM``, ``I2C``, ``SoftI2C``, ``SPI``, ``SoftSPI``, ``UART``, ``Timer``, ``RTC``, ``WDT``, ``SDCard``, and, where supported, ``DAC``, ``I2S``, and ``I2CTarget``. Pin assignments and peripheral conflicts remain board-specific, so consult the board schematic before combining these APIs with camera, display, storage, or codec hardware.

The inherited `esp <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/library/esp.html>`_ and `esp32 <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/library/esp32.html>`_ modules expose ESP32-port-specific system and peripheral functions. Availability of individual classes such as ``esp32.PCNT``, ``esp32.RMT``, and other SoC-specific blocks depends on the selected chip and ESP-IDF version.

GPIO and PWM Example
--------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from machine import Pin, PWM

   led = Pin(LED_GPIO, Pin.OUT)
   led.value(1)

   pwm = PWM(Pin(PWM_GPIO), freq=1000, duty_u16=32768)
   pwm.duty_u16(49152)
   pwm.deinit()

Replace ``LED_GPIO`` and ``PWM_GPIO`` with pins that are free on the selected board. Check the schematic and board configuration first because camera, display, storage, USB, and codec peripherals may already reserve GPIOs.

Networking APIs
---------------

The inherited `network <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/library/network.html>`_, `socket <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/library/socket.html>`_, and `select <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/library/select.html>`_ modules provide network-interface management and TCP/UDP communication. ``network.WLAN`` is enabled in the current product board configurations, but successful use still requires compatible networking hardware and firmware configuration.

The current board profiles disable `bluetooth <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/library/bluetooth.html>`_ and `espnow <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/library/espnow.html>`_. SSL/TLS, ``cryptolib``, WebSocket, WebREPL, and socket-event support depend on the ESP-IDF version used to build the firmware; see :doc:`../target-support/index` for the maintained support summary.

Connect to Wi-Fi
----------------

.. code-block:: python

   import network, time

   wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
   wlan.active(True)
   wlan.connect("ssid", "password")

   for _ in range(100):
       if wlan.isconnected():
           break
       time.sleep_ms(100)

   if not wlan.isconnected():
       raise OSError("Wi-Fi connection failed")
   print("address:", wlan.ifconfig()[0])

Wi-Fi requires compatible hardware and board configuration. Production code should apply a timeout, avoid printing credentials, and handle reconnects rather than waiting indefinitely.

Filesystem and Runtime APIs
---------------------------

ESP-VISION retains MicroPython virtual-filesystem and stream behavior, including `os <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/library/os.html>`_, `io <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/library/io.html>`_, `vfs <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/library/vfs.html>`_, and the built-in ``open()`` function. Board startup code mounts product storage such as ``/flash`` and ``/sdcard`` when the corresponding partition and hardware are available.

Runtime services remain available through `micropython <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/library/micropython.html>`_, `gc <https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.28.0/library/gc.html>`_, ``sys``, ``time``, and ``_thread``. ESP-VISION enables MicroPython threading with a GIL; vision objects and hardware resources should still be treated as shared resources unless an API explicitly documents concurrent use.

List Storage and Check Memory
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   import gc, os

   print("flash:", os.listdir("/flash"))
   if "sdcard" in os.listdir("/"):
       print("sdcard:", os.listdir("/sdcard"))

   gc.collect()
   print("free heap:", gc.mem_free())

Check for optional mount points before using them. ``gc.collect()`` can be useful before loading a large model or allocating a frame history, but repeatedly forcing collection in every frame loop may reduce throughput.

Structuring a Complex Application
---------------------------------

For developers familiar with ESP-IDF, an ``asyncio`` task is a cooperatively scheduled Python coroutine, not a FreeRTOS task. Multiple coroutines share one Python execution context and switch only when they ``await``. This is the preferred structure for control logic, network I/O, status reporting, and time-based work because it avoids concurrent access to camera, model, display, and frame-buffer objects.

The following structure assigns exclusive ownership of the vision pipeline to one coroutine while telemetry and health-monitoring coroutines consume only copied scalar results:

.. blockdiag::

   blockdiag {
     orientation = portrait;

     loop      [label = "MicroPython asyncio event loop"];
     vision    [label = "Vision task\ncapture / inference / preview"];
     state     [label = "Copied scalar state\nframe count / detections / timestamp"];
     telemetry [label = "Telemetry task\nserialize and transmit"];
     health    [label = "Health task\ndetect stalled pipeline"];

     loop -> vision;
     loop -> telemetry;
     loop -> health;
     vision -> state;
     state -> telemetry;
     state -> health;
   }

.. code-block:: python

   import asyncio
   import espdl
   import json
   import sensor
   import time

   MODEL = "/sdcard/espdet_pico_224_224_face.espdl"

   state = {
       "frames": 0,
       "detections": 0,
       "last_frame_ms": time.ticks_ms(),
   }
   state_lock = asyncio.Lock()

   async def vision_task(detector):
       while True:
           img = sensor.snapshot()
           results = detector.detect(img)
           for x, y, w, h, score, category in results:
               img.draw_rectangle(x, y, w, h, color=(255, 0, 0))
           img.flush()

           async with state_lock:
               state["frames"] += 1
               state["detections"] = len(results)
               state["last_frame_ms"] = time.ticks_ms()

           # Let ready control and network tasks run between frames.
           await asyncio.sleep_ms(0)

   async def telemetry_task():
       while True:
           await asyncio.sleep_ms(1000)
           async with state_lock:
               payload = json.dumps({
                   "frames": state["frames"],
                   "detections": state["detections"],
               })
           print("telemetry:", payload)
           # Replace print() with non-blocking socket transmission.

   async def health_task():
       while True:
           await asyncio.sleep_ms(500)
           async with state_lock:
               age = time.ticks_diff(
                   time.ticks_ms(), state["last_frame_ms"]
               )
           if age > 3000:
               print("warning: vision pipeline stalled")

   async def main():
       sensor.reset()
       sensor.set_pixformat(sensor.RGB565)
       sensor.set_framesize(sensor.QVGA)
       sensor.skip_frames(time=1000)
       detector = espdl.ESPDet(MODEL, score=0.5, nms=0.7)

       vision = asyncio.create_task(vision_task(detector))
       telemetry = asyncio.create_task(telemetry_task())
       health = asyncio.create_task(health_task())
       try:
           await asyncio.gather(vision, telemetry, health)
       finally:
           vision.cancel()
           telemetry.cancel()
           health.cancel()
           detector.deinit()

   asyncio.run(main())

Calls such as ``sensor.snapshot()``, inference, image processing, and ``img.flush()`` are synchronous. While one of these calls is running, other coroutines cannot run; the explicit ``await asyncio.sleep_ms(0)`` provides a scheduling point between frames. If a network operation can block, use an ``asyncio`` stream or non-blocking socket rather than a long blocking call.

Threads and Native Tasks
------------------------

The inherited ``_thread.start_new_thread()`` API creates another FreeRTOS task, but it is not equivalent to ``xTaskCreatePinnedToCore()`` as an application interface. Python does not expose task priority or core affinity here; MicroPython threads are pinned to ``MP_TASK_COREID`` and share the interpreter through the GIL. ``_thread.stack_size()`` can configure the stack allocated for subsequently created threads.

Use ``_thread`` only when a blocking operation cannot be integrated with ``asyncio``, protect shared Python data with ``_thread.allocate_lock()``, and keep camera, display, codec, model, and frame-buffer ownership in one thread unless an API explicitly documents thread safety. An IRQ or another thread can notify the event loop with ``asyncio.ThreadSafeFlag`` without directly manipulating vision objects.

For deterministic latency, explicit FreeRTOS priorities or core affinity, ISR-to-task notification, or continuous work that must proceed while Python holds the GIL, implement the worker as an ESP-IDF C/C++ component and expose a narrow Python API. In ESP-IDF terms, use ``asyncio`` tasks for application state machines, ``_thread`` for exceptional blocking integration, and native tasks for real-time services.

Check Availability on a Firmware
--------------------------------

Standard MicroPython API availability is controlled by ``overlay/micropython/ports/esp32/mpconfigport.h``, the selected board's ``mpconfigboard.h`` and ``mpconfigboard.cmake``, ESP-IDF version checks, and SoC capability macros. Because availability is not determined solely by the chip, the definitive check is the exact firmware:

.. code-block:: python

   help("modules")
   import machine
   help(machine)

Use ``hasattr()`` or a guarded import when an application must run across multiple ESP-VISION boards. To remove or add inherited APIs in a product firmware, follow :doc:`../how-to/customize-firmware`.

   Runnable examples that use only standard MicroPython APIs: ``example/00-HelloWorld/helloworld.py`` (first script), ``example/06-Peripherals/00-Storage/sdcard.py`` (filesystem), and ``example/06-Peripherals/02-WiFi/webrepl.py`` (Wi-Fi and WebREPL).
