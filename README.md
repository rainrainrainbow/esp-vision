# ESP-VISION

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_ZH.md)

## Overview

ESP-VISION is a MicroPython vision runtime for the ESP32 platform. It combines the MicroPython ESP32 port, image processing algorithms, and ESP-DL model inference so developers can build embedded vision applications with Python scripts.

Key features include:

- `sensor`, `image`, and `display` Python APIs for camera capture, image processing, preview, and LCD output.
- Common board runtime services for camera, display, storage, USB preview, JPEG, and board-specific peripherals.
- Vision algorithms based in part on OpenMV `imlib`, covering drawing, filtering, color tracking, feature detection, QR code, barcode, and AprilTag workflows.
- ESP-DL model inference helpers for object detection, pose detection, and image classification.
- Development through a VSCode-based host tool or [Web IDE](https://esp-vision-ide.espressif.tools/), with firmware builds available through `make` or `idf.py`.

## Quickstart

Prerequisites: ESP-IDF release/v5.5, release/v6.0, or master with the export script sourced (`idf.py` on `PATH`), and a supported ESP32-P4, ESP32-S3, or ESP32-S31 target board.

Build, flash, and monitor with `make`:

```bash
git clone --recursive <this-repo> esp-vision
cd esp-vision
make BOARD=ESP32_P4X_EYE ESPPORT=/dev/ttyACM0 build flash monitor
```

Or use the board-aware `idf.py` extension from the repository root:

```bash
idf.py --board ESP32_P4X_EYE -p /dev/ttyACM0 build flash monitor
```

Both the top-level Makefile and the `idf.py` extension run `prepare-micropython`: they verify that `lib/micropython` is checked out at MicroPython v1.28.0 commit `e0e9fbb17ed6fd06bb76e266ae554784c9c80804`, export a clean MicroPython build copy under `build/micropython/`, then apply `overlay/micropython/` to that copy.

## Architecture

The repository is organized around a MicroPython firmware build, board-specific hardware backends, shared platform services, and Python-facing vision modules.

### Source Tree

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `Makefile` | Top-level `make` build entry that wraps `idf.py` with the correct MicroPython ESP32 port flags. |
| `idf_ext.py` | Board-aware `idf.py` extension for building from the ESP-VISION repository root. |
| `micropython.cmake` | ESP-VISION MicroPython integration point, registering user modules, platform sources, board sources, include paths, and `ulab`. |
| `lib` | Pinned third-party submodules, including MicroPython, `ulab`, and ZXing-C++. |
| `overlay/micropython` | ESP-VISION MicroPython delta, using the same path layout as the MicroPython repository. |
| `boards` | Board packages containing per-board configuration, frozen manifests, and board-specific peripheral implementations. |
| `platform` | Runtime services shared by Python modules, including camera, preview, storage, display, USB, JPEG, and debug support. |
| `modules` | MicroPython C/C++ bindings exposed to scripts, including `sensor`, `image`, `display`, `imageio`, and `espdl`. |
| `components` | ESP-IDF components, including OpenMV `imlib` and the ZXing barcode backend. |
| `models` | Optional `.espdl` model assets loaded at runtime from board storage such as `/flash` or `/sdcard`. |
| `example` | MicroPython example scripts for camera, preview, storage, display, image processing, and ESP-DL workflows. |

### MicroPython Overlay

ESP-VISION uses MicroPython v1.28.0 as a fixed upstream baseline. Project-specific changes to the MicroPython ESP32 port are maintained under `overlay/micropython/`.

`prepare-micropython` applies the overlay to a generated build copy under `build/micropython/idf<ESP_IDF_VERSION>/micropython/`. The `lib/micropython` submodule remains a clean upstream reference and should not receive overlay changes.

### Adding a New Board

A board package is split across two locations: the MicroPython ESP32 port overlay (`overlay/micropython/ports/esp32/boards/<BOARD>/`) and the ESP-VISION repo (`boards/<BOARD>/`).

**1. MicroPython port side** — `overlay/micropython/ports/esp32/boards/<BOARD>/`:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `mpconfigboard.cmake` | IDF target and `SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS` chain. |
| `mpconfigboard.h` | MicroPython feature flags and USB strings. |
| `sdkconfig.board` | Board-specific ESP-IDF Kconfig overrides. |
| `partitions-*.csv` | Partition table. |
| `board.json`, `board.md` | Upstream board manifest metadata. |

**2. ESP-VISION side** — `boards/<BOARD>/`:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `boardconfig.h` | Pin assignments and board runtime constants. |
| `imlib_config.h` | OpenMV `imlib` feature switches. |
| `manifest.py` | Frozen Python modules. |
| `camera.c` | Board-specific camera backend. |
| `display.c` | LCD panel and backlight implementation. |
| `sdcard.c` | SD card power and card-detect implementation. |

**3. Build and flash**:

```bash
make BOARD=<NEW_BOARD> ESPPORT=/dev/ttyACM0 build flash monitor
idf.py --board <NEW_BOARD> -p /dev/ttyACM0 build flash monitor
```
